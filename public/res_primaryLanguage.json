My passion resides both in the creativity of design and formation as well as the intellectual rigor required to do and create what's never never been done. I'm working with newest front-end frameworks like Angular, React and Node. I have a broad career history from aerospace manufacturing to fine art and small business ownership. Iâ€™ve built strong skills in leadership, creativity, innovation, and problem solving. My ability to make decisions on the fly and think outside the box has been commended by both clients and managers and I take pride in the work that I do.",
